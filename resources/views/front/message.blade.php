        <p>We may all agree that 2020 has been a year of many unexpected, unexampled and uncertain global setbacks and great challenges. — Although this is the reality in which we live and may for some time to come, we desire very much for you to feel some relief during this festive season. </p>
        <p>In addition to this, {{ config('app.name') }} hopes to reassure you that we are confident and ready to manage, assist and continue to provide you with the excellent service for which you have been accustomed, even during this end-of-year period. </p>
        <p>Outlined below is a detailed schedule to ensure all your transactions over the festive season are performed with continued support and efficacy.</p>
        <p><strong class="text-info">Please note that operating days during this period are set out below: —</strong></p>
        <p>We will be available on 29 and 30 December as normal working days. However, from 24 December until and including 28 December, we shall not be operating at optimal capacity. We shall resume our holiday period from 31 December 2020 until, and including, 03 January 2021.</p>
        <p>Still, it is necessary to take note of the support you will receive even during this season. </p>
        <p><strong class="text-info">Categorically, it is outlined below for your convenience: —</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong class="text-info">Social Media</strong>
                <p>During the working periods, we will be fully responsive in replying to any questions sent via our social media channels. If urgent enquires are requisite, please contact our support team for assistance. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong class="text-info">Settlement Schedule</strong>
                <p>Our support system has been modified especially for this season, which means that our scheduling during our working days may cause slight delays. Also, it is important to note that settlement support shall not be available on 25 December 2020 and 01 January 2021. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, owing to UK Bank Holidays, from 24th December 2020, settlements may be postponed during 24th-30th December, but shall be processed on or after 30th December 2020.</p>
                <p>If you have any queries, please contact us at your earliest convenience.</p>

                <strong class="text-info">Chargebacks and Refunds</strong>
                <p>Although 26 December is universally recognised as a ‘holiday’, not all payment partners view this day as a non-processing day. For you, this means that chargebacks may still occur upon this date and shall indeed be counted as part of usual chargeback protocols – i.e., the prescribed 48-hour deadline in which time for you to respond. Failing such, the transaction shall be processed automatically, refunding your customer directly. </p>
                <p>We strongly encourage you to review chargebacks as per your normal procedure to avoid any unfortunate and unnecessary lost revenue during this period. To add, we encourage you to act as promptly as possible.</p>
                <p>Finally, refunds shall be processed throughout the holiday period. The only day there shall be a break against chargebacks is on 25 December in which case it will not count as a day uploaded against your account; it shall therefore count against your account from 26 December upon which date you shall have the usual 48 hours in which to respond.</p>
